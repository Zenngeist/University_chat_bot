Q.1)  Attempt all Parts: 
 (a) Draw the OSI Layered model and the TCP/IP layered model.  
 (b) What do you understand by a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)? Name the PDU for data link layer and 

network layer. 
 (c)  Name and define the three fundamental characteristics of data communication. 
 (d) Draw a hybrid topology with star backbone and four ring topologies. List the consequence of a 

single link failure in any one of the four ring topologies.

Q.2)   Attempt all Parts: 
 (a) Define bit stuffing. A bit string, 0111101111101111110, needs to be transmitted at the data link 

layer. What is the string actually transmitted after bit stuffing (highlight the stuffed bits)?   
 (b) Define bandwidth. Suppose a device is sending out data at a rate of 2000 bps. Calculate how long 

will it take to send a file of 100000 characters.  Assume 1 character contains 8 bits. 
 (c)  Define attenuation. The attenuation of a signal is −10 dB. What is the final signal power if it was 

originally 5W? 
 (d) List the three services provided by the data link layer to the network layer. Give one example for 

each category of service.

Q.3)     Attempt any Two Parts: 

 (a) Discuss five distinct differences between hub and bridge. Answer must be written in tabular form. 
 (b) Discuss five distinct differences between checksums and CRCs. Answer must be written in tabular 

form. 
 (c) Discuss five distinct differences between packet switching and circuit switching.  Answer must be 

written in tabular form.

Q.4)     Attempt any Two Parts: 
 (a) The distance between source and destination is 9 * 1010 m, Calculate the channel utilization if a 

stop-and-wait protocol is used for transmission on a 64 Mbps channel. Assume frame size to be 32 
KB and speed of light is 3 * 108 m/s. 

 (b) Consider a 50 Kbps satellite channel with a 250-millisecond propagation delay. Using one-bit sliding 
window protocol and frame size of 1000 bit, calculate the percentage of time the sender is blocked 
i.e., not able to send any frame.  

 (c) What is the total latency for a frame of size 5,000,000 bits that is being sent on a link with 10 
intermediate devices (i.e. covers 10 hops) each having a queuing time of 2 µs and a processing time 
of 1 µs. The length of the link is 2000 km. The speed of propagation inside the link is 2 × 108 m/s. 
The link has a bandwidth of 5 Mbps.

Q.5)     Attempt any Two Parts: 

 (a) Explain with diagram Go-Back-N (GBN) and Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) 
techniques. Your explanation should make it clear when GBN is best suited and when Selective 
Repeat is best suited. 

 (b) Explain with diagram the structure of an optic fiber cable. What is the approx. core width in single 
mode and multimode fiber? How are the fibers laid in ground, and in deep sea water? 

 (c) A 12-bit hamming code 111001001111 arrives at the receiver. Check if the received message is 
correct or not. What was the original bit pattern sent on the medium? Assume single bit error and 
even parity. Show all steps in detail.
