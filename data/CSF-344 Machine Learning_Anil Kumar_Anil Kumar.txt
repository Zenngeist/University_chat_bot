(a) Lasso regression 
(b) Multi-Variate Regression 
(c) Ridge Regression 
(d) Conditional Probability 
(e) Joint Probability 

 (b) Elaborate the concept of Bayes Theorem and apply it to solve the following: 
A box of cartridges contains 30 cartridges, of which 6 are defective. If 3 of the cartridges are removed from 
the box in succession without replacement, what is the probability that all the 3 cartridges are defective? 

 (c) What is Over fitting and Under fitting, and How to overcome?
