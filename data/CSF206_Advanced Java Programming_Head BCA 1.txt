Q.3)     Attempt any Two Parts : 
 (a) Explain the difference between AWT and Swing in Java.  
 (b) Design a Java Swing application that uses a BorderLayout. Place a JButton in the SOUTH region, a 

JTextField in the NORTH, and a JTextArea in the CENTER. When the button is pressed, append the 
text from the JTextField into the JTextArea. 

 (c) Write a Java program to create an ArrayList of integers. Add five integers to it and then perform the 
following operations:

Q.4)     Attempt any Two Parts : 

 (a) Develop a Swing application using JFrame that contains a JLabel centered in the window. The JLabel 
should display the text "Hello, Swing!" Ensure the application exits properly when the window is 
closed. 

 (b) Implement a Stack using LinkedList in Java, including methods for push, pop, and peek operations. 
 (c) Write a simple java program that demonstrates the creation of a thread in Java using both the 

Thread class and the Runnable interface.

Q.5)     Attempt any Two Parts : 

 (a) Write a Swing application called SwingAdder as shown. The "ADD" button adds the two integers 
and display the result. The "CLEAR" button shall clear all the text fields. 

 
 (b) What are adapter classes in Java? Write the importance of these classes for developers when working 

with event-driven interfaces. Provide details on five adapter classes offered by Java, along with the 
corresponding interfaces. 

 (c) Provide a basic example of a Java applet and explain how its life cycle methods are implemented in 
the code?
