Q.1)  Attempt all Parts : 
 (a) How do routers exchange routing table updates in dynamic routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, and 

BGP? 
 (b) Analyze frequency bands 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz used in wireless networks, and identify any two 

differences between them. 
 (c)  How does Mobile IP enable mobile devices to maintain connectivity while moving between 

different networks? 
 (d) What happens if there are two or more paths to the same network with different metrics? Which 

path will be chosen?

Q.2)   Attempt all Parts : 
 (a) Assess the effectiveness of wireless network components in meeting the performance requirements 

and user expectations. 
 (b) A block of addresses is granted to a small organization. We know that one of the addresses is 

194.168.32.56/30. What will be the first address and the last address in the block? 
 (c)  Explain how Mobile IP works in a simplified scenario, highlighting its key components and the process 

involved when a mobile device moves from one network to another. 
 (d) In a cellular network, a particular cell has 30 available channels. If the reuse factor is 4, how many 

cells can exist within the same cluster? What is the total number of available channels for the entire 
cellular system?

Q.3)     Attempt any Two Parts : 

 (a) Consider a small network with four routers: A, B, C, and D, interconnected as follows: 
A is directly connected to B and D. 
B is directly connected to A, C, and D. 
C is directly connected to B and D. 
D is directly connected to A, B, and C. 
The cost of each link is as follows: 
A-B: 2 
A-D: 3 
B-C: 1 
B-D: 2 
C-D: 2 
Assume that the initial distance vector at each router is: 
Router A: (A:0, B:2, C:∞, D:3) 
Router B: (A:2, B:0, C:1, D:2) 
Router C: (A:∞, B:1, C:0, D:2) 
Router D: (A:3, B:2, C:2, D:0) 
Calculate the distance vectors at each router after one iteration using RIP. 

 (b) Suppose you are tasked with optimizing the coverage of a cellular network in a rural area with low 
population density. How would you strategically place cell towers to ensure the best coverage while 
minimizing infrastructure costs? 

 (c) Describe the differences between RIP and RIPng regarding addressing and protocol features.

Q.4)     Attempt any Two Parts : 

 (a) A cellular network operates with a frequency reuse factor of 3. Each cell in the network uses a total 
of 40 MHz of frequency spectrum for communication. Calculate the total available frequency 
spectrum in the network and determine the bandwidth allocated to each cell if there are 30 cells in 
total. 

 (b) Compare the various versions of IEEE 802.11. 
 (c) An ISP is granted a block of addresses starting with 150.80.0.0/16. The ISP wants to distribute these 

blocks to 2600 customers as follows. 
a. The first group has 200 medium-sized businesses; each needs 128 addresses. 
b. The second group has 400 small businesses; each needs 16 addresses. 
c. The third group has 2000 households; each needs 4 addresses. 
Design the sub-blocks and give the slash notation for each sub-block. Find out how many addresses 
are still available after these allocations.

Q.5)     Attempt any Two Parts : 

 (a) Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of OSPF compared to RIP routing protocols. 

 (b) Explain in detail about the following related cellular communication systems: 
(i) Frequency Reuse 
(ii) Hand-off mechanisms 

 (c) Assume that source S and destination D are connected through two intermediate routers labeled R. 
Explain how many times each packet must visit the network layer and the physical layer during 
transmission from S to D.
