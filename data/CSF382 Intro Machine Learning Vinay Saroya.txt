Q.1)  Attempt all Parts: 
 (a) Explain the following terms:                                                                                                 

I. Random variable 
II. Conditional Probability 

 (b) A jar contains 10 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 3 green marbles. If one marble is drawn at 
random, solve the probability of: 
i. Not green 
ii. Red 
iii. Not blue 

 (c)  An urn contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. Balls are drawn one at a time without replacement until 
all the red balls are drawn. Evaluate the probability that exactly 5 draws are needed to remove all 
the red balls?  

 (d) A tutoring service specializes in preparing adults for high school equivalence tests. Among all the 
students seeking help from the service, 63% need help in mathematics, 34% need help in English, 
and 27% need help in both mathematics and English. Evaluate the percentage of students who need 
help in either mathematics or English?

Q.2)   Attempt all Parts: 
 (a) Explain the following terms:                                                                                                 

I. Supervised Learning 
II. Regression 

 (b) Describe three machine learning problems and their solutions. 
 (c)  In a machine learning model, what do the terms "training Set" and "test Set" mean? 
 (d) Describe the five-stage process of machine learning.

Q.3)     Attempt any Two Parts: 

 (a) Differentiate between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.  
 (b) Demonstrate how does overfitting affect classification models and what techniques can be 

employed to prevent it? 
 (c) Differentiate between multi-class classification and binary classification? What algorithms would 

be used for a multi-class problem?

Q.4)     Attempt any Two Parts: 
 (a) Classify the operators used in Python programming language.  Write a program to print the given 

number is odd or even. 
 (b) Compare the different types of conditional statements in Python? Write a program to check if the 

given number is palindrome or not. 
 (c) Explain type conversion in python. Write several functions for explicit type conversion.

Q.5)     Attempt any Two Parts: 
 (a) Discuss the module and library. How can two NumPy arrays be compared? What distinguishes 

NumPy's np.mean() from np.average()?  
 (b) Distinguish overfitting from underfitting? What role do they play in data visualization?  
 (c) In the NumPy array, examine how is it possible to count the number of times a specific positive 

value appears?
