Q.1)  Attempt all Parts : 
 (a) Two vectors X and Y are defined as follows:  

X <- c(3, 2, 4) and Y <- c(1, 2). 
 
What will be output of vector Z that is defined as Z <- X*Y. 

 (b) Write the difference between list and vector with proper program. 
 (c)  What happens if we try to store a different data types in a vector. Explain with example. 
 (d) Write a program to create a list, name its variable and access them with the help of assigned names.  
  [4 x 5= 20] 
 
Q.2)   Attempt all Parts : 
 (a) How to convert a list into a vector explain with suitable program? 
 (b) What is the output of the following program: 

vec = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 4, 6)  
count = 0 
x = 4 
for(i in vec){  
  if(vec[i] == x){  
      count = count + 1  
      }  
    } 
print(count) 

 (c)  Write about type conversion in R with suitable program. 
 (d) Write a program to find the mean, median, standard deviation and variance of the following numbers: 

5, 7, 6, 9, 11, 10, 7, 6, 12, 9, 3, 6, 1, 11, 14, 10, 2 
  [4 x 5= 20] 
 
Q.3)     Attempt any two parts: 

 (a) Write a program a read an excel file using xlsx package and write its data to another sheet say “newsheet” of 
same excel file. 

 (b) Write a program create a matrix of four rows and three columns and demonstrate use of rbind and cbind 
operations on created matrix. 

 (c) Create the following vectors in R: 
a = (5, 10, 15, 20, … , 100) b = (99, 98, 97, … , 50) 
Use vector arithmetic to multiply these vectors and call the result ‘c’. Select subsets of c to identify the 
following: 
 
(i) What are the 10th, 11th, and 12th elements of c? 
(ii) How many elements of vector c are less than 1000? 

  [2 x 10= 20] 
 
Q.4)     Attempt any two parts : 

 (a) Write a program to find the mode of given dataset using functions. 
 (b) Write a program to add a row in existing data frame and print the summary and structure.
